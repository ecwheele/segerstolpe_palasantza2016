Comment[Submitted Name]	Whole-islet RNA-sequencing analysis of human pancreas from healthy individuals and type 2 diabetes patients				
Experiment Description	We performed whole-islet RNA-sequencing of human pancreatic islets from healthy and T2D individuals in order to compare the expression data to the corresponding single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the same donors (related single-cell study: Single-cell analysis of human pancreas and T2D, deposited at ArrayExpress under accession E-MTAB-5061: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-5061/).

Protocol Description	Human primary islets were purchased from Prodo Laboratories Inc (Irvine, CA, USA) 	Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library prep kit following the manufacturers recommendations.	Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced at a final concentration of 1.6 pM	We quantified gene expression as RPKMs as defined in Ramsk√∂ld et al., 2009	Qiagen RNeasy microkit with on-column DNAse digestion (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Swizerland)
